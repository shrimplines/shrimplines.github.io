humans crave control, but mostly fake control. we invent beginnings because uncertainty feels unbearable. beginnings do not exist. i’m bad at recounting events. i take forever. i avoid questions that demand a start point. every event is tangled with infinite prior conditions. the butterfly effect is real in my head. laplace’s demon says if you knew the position of every atom, everything would happen. everything already happened. so where do i start? the start of the day? midnight? my birth? my conception? the atoms that first carried my genetic material? arbitrary. even the universe may not have a beginning. why pretend my life fits into paragraphs and chapters that imply origin, trajectory, and closure?

i tried dividing my life into chapters. it felt romantic. it was a neat illusion. memory and meaning dissolved into a sequence that was never mine. chapters are for readers, not reality. some time feels hollow. some time floats like gold in water. bergson called it durée, lived time, layered and folded. wittgenstein said the limits of language are the limits of the world. when i try to translate thought into sequence, it flattens, it prunes, it murders the chaos of experience.

identity is relational. we become what others believe us to be, what they observe, and what we imagine they imagine about us. cooley’s looking glass self explains part of it, but observation does not merely reflect—it sculpts. the child who grows up without human contact but is observed shows this: witnessing is formative. linearity in identity is a lie. we are always recombinatory, entangled, in flux. society demands coherence. they judge the puppet without naming the puppeteer. linear narratives are violence. they flatten, erase, imply closure that never existed. recounting an event is compressing it, performing it, showing only the version digestible to humans. shortcut creatures, not truth creatures. lie to survive, to please, to show only the shapes that fit expectations, while the truth folds in ways no story can hold.

sometimes thought itself escapes sequence. language is a lossy codec. meaning is deferred. derida would nod. my mind moves in spirals, loops, and knots. i grab ideas, trip, contradict myself, fall, run in the opposite direction, leave previous threads curling into patterns that cannot be described but are felt. i ignore conventions, stumble over vocabulary. the motion itself contains its own logic. control is a joke sometimes. i want to believe there’s a point in all of this. i want to feel cool, to measure myself against the universe, to people-please, to spin in my chaos all at once.

i am temporary. not incomplete. not unstable. temporary. a checkpoint in a network that refuses serialization. density, attention, entanglement—that is the only chapter.

linear thinkers may grow impatient. that is fine. this is not for everyone. this is for minds that understand time as gold in water, that feel identity as a network rather than an arc, that recognize the spaces between events rather than the arrow pointing at them.

sometimes i feel like a hybrid of engineering, psychology, and philosophy, a little feral, a little precise, a little ironic. my story is messy, spiral, self-correcting. i can tell a story, but i do not confuse the story with the event itself.
