If it is Orange, the word count is too low or the logic is trippi of this card is a thick green stripe, the system is working. If it is Orange, the word count is too low or the logic is trippioing so, we are testing the **High-Contrast Green** (`#ABE27A`) logic. If the title above is Green and the left border of this card is a thick green stripe, the system is working. If it is Orange, the word count is too low or the logic is tripping.

> **Note:** We are also testing the blockquote style here. It should feel integrated but distinct, helping the "Sanctuary" aesthetic feel more like a lab report.

## 02. Interactive Elements
Below this paragraph, we should see how the body text interacts with your theme slider. 
* **Light Mode:** Charcoal text on light gray.
* **Sepia Mode:** Deep brown on cream.
* **Dark Mode:** Soft gray on near-black.

## 03. The Gallery Bridge
Even though this is a "Post" layout, we can still use images. Let's ensure they respect the rounded corners we've established:

## 04. Pushing the Word Count (The 500+ Goal)
To ensure we hit that 500-word mark for the green theme, let's reflect on the architecture. The sanctuary is built on a foundation of Tailwind CSS and Jekyll. Every card is a `neuo-card`, a custom class designed to mimic the tactile feel of physical objects—like a stack of cards or a sticky note on a desk.

The logic in the `post.html` layout is as follows:
1. It counts the strings in this file.
2. It compares that number to 500.
3. It assigns a hex code to a variable.
4. It injects that hex into the CSS classes for the Title and the Border.

We are building a system that is smart but lightweight. By using Liquid (the Jekyll language), we don't need heavy JavaScript to change colors. The server does it once during the build process. This is why Vercel is so important—it's the factory that puts these pieces together.

Let's keep going. We need more volume. Imagine a bag of shrimp chips. They are light, airy, and they have a specific crunch. That is what we want the UI to feel like. Not heavy like a government website, but not so light that it feels broken. The "Return" button at the bottom is the final piece of that puzzle. It should remain humble—gray and quiet—until you hover over it. At that moment, it should "glow" with the theme color of the page. Since this post is (hopefully) green, the button should glow Green.

## 05. Technical Metadata
When we look at the sidebar, we see the "shrimp chips" branding. It stays sticky. As you scroll through this long test, the sidebar should remain your
